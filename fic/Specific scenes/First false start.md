When we think of a small house, we usually picture something very cramped. No more than two or three different rooms, three people sleeping in the same bed and all surfaces covered in everybody’s mess. The air would be near unbreathable when everybody was home, which is why people made their lives outside; where the sun cast midday heat over the shoulders of farmers and barefoot children alike, and a gust of wind would refresh your ability to breathe.

Because George was a young only child, living in a small house wasn’t inherently unpleasant; he just found it desperately dull. He didn’t like chores, he didn’t like playing alone and he didn’t like having only his mom Hanna to talk to. That is, if she wasn’t telling him stories.

These could come unprompted; Hanna would often call him to her side to tell him a specific tale she’d somehow forgotten to tell him sooner, and he loved every second of it. He liked letting his imagination picture the people of her tales, and the unusual way she had to tell them; with vocal curlicues and wide hand gestures, mentioning how her father used to tell these same stories to her and making it feel relevant to be the one hearing them today.

Sometimes, he would come to ask her about some name he’d overheard in the village.

His mom was talking with her sister Ada in the dining room over their sewing labor; and a thirteen year old George had just arrived home in a sort of hurry which could wait but he definitely didn’t want it to.

“What’s Saint Lumm?” George interrupted them suddenly, making both figures look up with gentle surprise.

She frowned, taken a bit aback, and then chuckled. “You don’t know who Saint Lumm is?”

“I would have thought you were wiser than to let father’s tales die of old age,” his aunt said with her usual sing-songy tone of voice, like she had been a jester in a past life —both of them were very playful in their manners—. Then, she looked back at George and lowered her volume like she was about to tell him a secret, and said, “Saint Lumm was the man who fell in love with Hades.”

“Oh, be quiet,” his mom cut her off. “That’s not true, it’s not true. Saint Lumm is the guardian of this place, George” she said dramatically. But George didn’t want theatrics, he wanted answers. He sat on the floor.

“Who is he?”

“Saint Lumm was a young man from a few generations back. Your grandfather’s father must have known him personally, for sure, because Saint Lumm is told to have been very popular. Not because he was an especially outgoing man, mind you,” she chuckled, “but because not a single pair of ears were left free from his rambling.”

“He was crazy like that,” his aunt added.

“Oh, he definitely was,” they laughed. “Definitely. Everyone talked about this guy who never shut up about this other realm who nobody has ever seen. Full of darkness and Void, the breath of the stars, the kingdom without a king. He said he would become the king to free the humans from every single illness and disgrace they knew.”

“He did go a little overboard, though,” his aunt interjected. “Saint Lumm was just a crazy man with enough poetry to soften the people’s hearts. He was convinced the only way to get to this sort of kingdom of evil was through the Nether.” She clicked her tongue a couple of times, to give effect. George’s mind was already drawing vivid imagery of this man’s delirium. “So, one day, he walked into it and he never came back.”

The woman went silent for a moment. George was about to get mad at that ending before she continued. “And that’s the last anyone knew about him.”

“What?!” he demanded in his high pitched voice. “That ’s it? Why is he even the guardian of anywhere? He was just some random guy who went crazy and got himself killed!”

“No. There is a good reason he is the guardian,” Hanna said in a more serious tone. “For a long time after he left, people were half expecting him to come back as a king, or otherwise as an almost dead man. The Nether is no place for people, George. The only thing that could ever bring a man into it is greed. But young men are impressionable,” she said with some spite, “they believe themselves invincible and leave everything behind for a mirage of wealth. I won’t deny that our village feeds recklessness, for sure, but Saint Lumm did it so that others wouldn’t. Years after he left, every kid who ventured beyond the portals was found days later entering through the palisade. Every man and woman alike would come back from the Nether untouched, but robbed.”

Then she went quiet, kept sewing, with the tense jaw she had when she still had words to say but they hurt her to her very core. His aunt seemed to want to say something, but stayed quiet for her sister’s sake.

“He guarded the doors to the Nether?” Voice small.

“He did. He sacrificed his own ambitions of kingship to stay in the Nether, to keep people safe. To throw the children back to safety and rob the adults of their greed. Kick some sense into their heads. Saint Lumm was a good man, George, not a crazy one.”

A silence came over the table as George pictured, with awe, how a man that brave could have ever existed within these walls. Although he would never dare venturing inside himself, he’d heard of a plain barren, asphyxiating and hostile, where everything felt extremely young because even the ground seemed unsettled, barely kept together by roots and animal carcasses. The mountains were high and abrupt, the cliffs deadly and frequent, and they gave way to endless oceans of molten lava where many had found their brutal, final moments. Saint Lumm must have been an extremely brave and selfless man to choose to live in a place like that, only to make sure nobody would follow him to hell…

“Saint Lumm was a stupid lunatic,” came the words of a soft faced aunt of his.

Two pairs of eyes snapped up to her. Hanna raised an eyebrow. Ada wasn’t looking her in the eye, and while at the time George thought that it was out of modesty, he understood just later that it was quite the contrary.

“What do you mean?” his mom respectfully asked.

“He was a lunatic. And no more than a poet with a dream of greatness,” Ada started talking loudly and unapologetically, almost with disdain to this figure. “He spent the better half of his life running his mouth about how he was going to be the One, the Big One, the King of All Things who would abolish literal illness.

“Everyone saw him as good, just very naive,” she continued with countering gestures. “Then he walked through the gates of the Nether, he was going to become what he promised, and then he never followed. He stayed there, he chose to stay there. He could have guarded the doors from outside the portals, he could have destroyed the portals, has that ever occurred to you?” She was looking at his mom. George’s mouth was hanging open. They never confronted each other. “He fell in love with Hades, he liked it in there. He chose to abandon his people in order to live in hell, he fell in love with Hades,” she repeated.

Hanna was clearly annoyed. “He kept the people away from that realm. What you’re saying is distasteful. He did ten times more than everybody else when the kids were going missing beyond the portals. He gave them back.” His aunt shook her head along, but a frown never appeared in her face.

“No, no. He robbed the people who were desperate enough to venture into that place. He wanted nobody in his realm.”

George was watching the two like who watches a tennis match.

“He robbed them to teach them—” Ada scoffed at this, “teach them how their greed would only bring death to their futures. The Nether is deadly. Gold is not worth lives. And countless men and women have burned in the pits looking to carry back sackfuls of gold.”

“No. If Saint Lumm truly cared about his people, he would have come back as the king he promised.” His mom went quiet at this. “Lumm would have been remembered as the hero, the man who saved us from illness. Dear, the Nether was only ever the last option for the people who were hungry enough. Whose children were starving. They preferred a quick death in the lava pits to dying slowly from an empty stomach. With their kids in their arms.” Ada nodded at her own words. “There were pests after he died, there were fevers, famines. Where was his legacy when father followed our brother to the grave, from the yellow fever that he promised to abolish?” Hanna didn’t say anything. Just stared at her with a deep frown. “He didn’t care. He wanted to stay and he chose to stay.”

There was a long silence. The tension was extremely obvious and George was deeply uncomfortable. He started cracking his fingers.

“He did more than anyone else did to keep people safe.” He stopped cracking his fingers. “If you care so much, go into the Nether yourself. Go into the realm of the Void he talked about and abolish illness yourself. Do something about it.”

His aunt shook her head again, distasted, and focused back on her labor.
