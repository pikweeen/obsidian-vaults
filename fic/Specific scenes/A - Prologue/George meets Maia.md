## Objectives
- George and Maia end up making out
- Show how George isn't here on his own volition. He doesn't like Maia that much, but he accepts the fact that they're making out because that's what's happening, and he as always has a passive role in all this. He GUESSES he's okay with this.
- Maia likes him more than he likes her, but she's mainly going for it because her family is very annoying about getting with a man. She also wants to try things out.

Maia is autistically good at being social. She has figured it out, she's constantly masking, learning intently and adapting quickly. She appears social herself because of that, but George is too creeped out by her observance that he can't chillax. She watches both his and her reactions very closely, some of the things she says sound artificial to George.

Her family has been kind of pushy lately with her not having gone near a man in years, and she kind of doesn't really want to? She doesn't want to try, but she guesses she will try. And when she meets George, she finds out that she is dipping into hypersexuality. 

vale so the bad part about this chapter is that Maia makes no sense, i made her angry that her family wanted her to have children and then she immediately threw it all out the window and kissed George, she was too easy to convince.
