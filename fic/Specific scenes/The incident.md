Dream is fucking terrified, he's fully on fight or flight, he's so out of it he's probably not going to remember this. When he sees George starting to get cornered by the hoglin he just fucking runs full speed into him and tackles him five meters further with his shoulder. It's so strong it hurts George for weeks. 
Dream's face is wild, extremely tense, sweaty (with tears?), (remaining) eye red with heat and stress, and he just fucking screams at the beast so much it feels like his head is going to explode. The hoglin cowers a little bit, but it's a fucking hoglin so it doesn't run away. Dream yells again, and as the hoglin makes a move toward him, he manages to apply some of the knowledge Technoblade taught him.
