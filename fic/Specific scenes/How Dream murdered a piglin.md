 Dream encounters a Ghast. This is what caused him to lose his eye. He panics. He runs in the opposite direction. He ends up hiding in a cave where coincidentally there's a piglin. He clutches it by it's clothing, getting all in it's face (it's dumbfounded) and passes out. The piglin helps him a little bit while he's passed out, but when he wakes up, shit happens and Dream kills it. Mention how **he misses some hits because of his missing eye**.

Just to make it extra traumatizing, Dream becomes frozen when he realizes what he's done. For the next few hours he sits next to the body. He eats next to it, stares at it, looks at its every detail. Steals some of its jewellery, not for vanity or to sell it, but to keep something about it. The body gets cold and Dream remains by its side. Its wide fingers become stiff with death and Dream remains by its side. He cries the death of an intelligent creature. He keeps thinking about the fear in its eyes, the conscience in its tears of horror and pain. He will never get away from this guilt.

Or alternatively make it a single arrow. Make it quiet. Make silence loom over Dream's head.
