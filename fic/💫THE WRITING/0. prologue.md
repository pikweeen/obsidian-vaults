They say the body can get used to anything. Feet eventually thicken for harsh earth, the cold eventually files down its claws, the threshold for unimaginable pain eventually heightens. To George, this could not be more maddening.

As the winter season makes its way down the mountains, neighbors drop their imperfect jackets onto the pile of the family shop for him to mend. A missing button? He was your man. A pocket coming undone? You'd be the fifth person that week, that'll be 7 ems please! At least two people every day tripped on the step at the entryway when they walked out, and every time George had warned them with plenty of time. 

George sunk his nose back behind the pile of broken garments as a client walked out, his greasy bangs getting in the way of his eyes. His hands worked a patch into a pair of ugly, old man trousers. He was almost as good as his aunt, who had been working the craft for at least two decades longer. He secretly took pride in this, but doubly secretly, he didn't, not really. 

—That kid has always looked like a bloody clown —murmured aunt Ava quietly as the client left the shop, and then gave a scoff like she was amused with herself. With around fifty people to pick from in the entire village, the bar to being a clown seemed to have lowered to wearing ill-fitting trousers. 

Just as George was about to spit out a bored 'Huh?', a loud woman's voice begun to be heard from just outside the shop. George wanted to walk out into the beach and bury himself below the deepest sands of the ocean for One Hundred Years.

—George, hun, where were you?! I've been looking for you everywhere! —yelled his mom's voice, screeching its way into his brain. He'd been where he always is— You need to fix these for me. —She was holding around 5 bulky garments, it was hard to tell. She threw them onto his workbench, ignoring the pile.

—Alr- —he begun to say.

Her hair looked dishevelled as always, and her chronically alcohol-reddened face contorted into an uncanny excuse for a smile. —Have you met Maia? —she asked, wildly changing topics.

—Uh, not really. I've seen her but we've never-- 

—I figured, you never talk to anyone! You're such a little hermit sometimes. —She stared into George's eyes, and he didn't know if she was challenging him to respond or if she was just reaffirming herself in her head given his unkempt appearance. She went quiet for a beat. George stared at her in annoyed confusion— You're going to meet her —she declared.

—What for?

—*What for, what for.* Things don't always happen in ways that you can box down, George, let things be. —George raised an eyebrow. *Okay*, he thought. Just 30 more years and she'd be dead. Probably less, if she kept drinking at this rate.

—You're right, mom —he forced out. He got up off his chair and stretched the rage away—. I'll go talk to her —he said, hoping to get an excuse to leave the shop and go mind his business for a couple hours. He wasn't planning on actually talking to that random girl. 

—Exactly, let's go talk to her —she inserted herself, grabbing his skinny wrist and dashing for the door. 

They walked for two minutes, and to George's dismay, Maia was not busy at all when they arrived to her place. It was a small barbershop manned by her mom which doubled as a doctor's office manned by her dad. The girl herself was unremarkable, George thought. She was short and stocky, and he could count the amount of words they'd said to each other with a single hand.

When Maia noticed them, she reacted to the two of them so distinctly George thought she did it on purpose. She smiled widely at his mom, going in for two kisses and asking vaguely about her recent events, while dedicating a tense mouth gesture to him as a hello. He did not mind, they did not know each other.

—Maia, Maia, Maia, this is my son George —his mom said. He smiled apologetically. 

—I know! —Maia politely replied. His mom took both their hands and forced them together in a vigorous handshake, which had the two kids visibly in shock, her more in a bashful way and him more in a what-the-fuck-are-you-doing way. 

—Um —said a mortified George.

—It's crazy you two haven't talked before, I mean, look at her, George! Isn't she gorgeous? —and she looked at him like she was expecting an actual answer. He nodded hesitantly— See? And Maia, just look at him, he's so close to looking... —George looked at her wide-eyed, silently begging her to stop— Yes, yes, you two have a lot of things in common. I'll leave you two to it! —And she left in a half jog like she just threw a smoke bomb.

—I'm sorry —George murmured.

—It's okay —Maia replied with a really kind of sweet smile—, my mom is the exact same. —George chuckled softly. He felt bad that his mom had dragged her into meeting with some random guy she didn't know.

—Hey, I know she probably put you kind of on the spot with this, we don't have to--

—Oh no, no, I don't mind at all. It´s always nice meeting new people, right? —And she fixed her bun as she spoke, smiling at him with a sense of familiarity. He watched her mannerisms with some tension, tilting his head like an especially confused puppy. 

—Oh. Yeah! Sure.

—Do you... want to walk to the lake together? —She gave a short laugh, seeming awkward suddenly— Or, I don't know. —She stepped vaguely in the direction of the lake, then seemed to reconsider— We can get something to eat if you'd prefer--

—The lake sounds great —he said earnestly. His hand twitched, unsure whether he should hold her hand. He decided it would be weird probably.  Instead, Maia reached out and took his hand herself. He decided it wasn't weird anymore. 

The walk was rather nice, if a little bit awkward. The approaching winter provided a cushion of dead leaves and pinecones on the earth, and their every step lifted a few droplets of old rainwater trapped in the foliage. Her hair was a pit of tar swallowing every stray ray of sunlight the winter sky managed to let through; soft, short, the blackest hair he'd seen. 

Maia had a deep, impenetrable stare, which clashed massively with her sweet face. Her short bangs kept getting in her eyes, and she kept moving them away. George thought she looked kind of out of her element; he'd seen her talk to people in town, she was very energetic, liked a fast paced, closely knit social environment. Sticking her next to George was like putting a border collie in a waiting room.

When they arrived to the lake, Maia sat down at the edge of the water, muddying her long white skirt which she didn't seem to pay a single thought to. He wondered if she would bring it to his shop for him to fix later, if this is how people inexplicably came to him with garments looking like they were just fished out of a swamp or lost a fight against a wild boar. He sat down next to her, who cared? She removed her shoes and wiggled her toes in the mud. 

George wondered if Maia was picking him apart with those eyes.
