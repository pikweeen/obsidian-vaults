<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/><span type="end"/> did not remember <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>'s father to be so terrifying, although most likely he wasn't the type of man to go around scaring young men *before* they've "gotten with" his daughter, so <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> guessed it made sense.

Dr. <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest_dad"/>Edgar<span type="end"/> <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest_lastname"/>Achar<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> seemed to be very reserved, much like his daughter. A tall, lanky gentleman, quietly confident in his status, the kind you'd expect to have crazy comebacks when it matters. Except he didn't. His mouth could be sealed shut as far as <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> knew, but his deep, sunken eyes could speak all the same. The man communicated through subtle brow gestures and soft smiles, dark eyebags protruding below his eyes and thin lips the single points of interest to decipher him, his wife and kids wordlessly understanding and acting through. 

Entering through the door of the <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest_lastname"/>Achar<span type="end"/> household required first holding eye contact with Dr. <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest_lastname"/>Achar<span type="end"/> for a solid ten seconds as you approached the house, the man endlessly rocking on his old chair in the porch, his image missing only a shotgun for him to wipe and wipe while threateningly eyeing you up and down. 

<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/> was so similar to him in so many ways.

Grey irises behind hooded lids watched quietly, registering his micro expressions, reading his words by looking instead of hearing. <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> didn't even think she was trying to judge, but rather just learning every little thing about his mannerisms, deciphering what he *really* meant when he said *x* or *y* by memory like she had to recite it all by the end of every day. 

Her lips were strangely soft and still when they kissed, <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> could feel her ungiving teeth right behind them with little force. She was not tentative, never experimented with movement. It seemed she only kissed him first to give him permission to start the kisses from then on. And yet she laughed at his jokes, her touch felt strangely endearing, made him feel warm and fuzzy, and he found her smell to be relaxing.

In the morning of their second week together the sky was a light shade of blue and the village was bustling with activity, coming in and out of <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>'s house with the relaxed, mundane energy often found in groups of middle-aged people working together to make an event happen: a big feast, inviting all of <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>'s and <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/>'s family tree. It had been their mothers' idea. The big table would be hosted in an inner patio in her house, whose walls had for years remained covered in faintly colored wall shrubs nurturing hundreds of little bright orange flowers, organized in rounded clusters which to <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/>'s eyes would make perfect gifts for a girl such as <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>, but he decided nobody would appreciate being gifted flowers from their own garden.

On the count of three, <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> and <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> hoisted up a wood panel in his house and started carefully walking to <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>'s, to set it up for the long table.

—This is so shit —<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/> huffed—, they gave us busy work right up until dinner is set on the goddamn table. —<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> had the impulse to shrug, but the panel was too heavy. He didn't reply. <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/> flipped her hair out of her face— I'm so hungry as well.

—We have to help at the kitchen later. —She rolled her eyes. *Is it really that bad?*— Maybe you can get some snacks in while we do that, because it looks like it's gonna be a few hours until we sit down to eat. —<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> could feel the blood leaving his fingers as the wood dug into his skin, his forearms already starting to burn. He really should get more exercise.

<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>'s black ends contrasted over the pale skin of her chest. She had freckles all over her body for all <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> knew, and there was a thick, pale one on each of her boobs, visible right now as they bounced ever so slightly as they walked towards her house. #PhysicalDescription_<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/> They gave him something nice to look at while the rest of his body was burning with exertion.

—Hey, I thought maybe we could do something after the dinner —<span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> tried, tearing his vision from her in an attempt at respect—. It looks like it's going to be a nice night, we could go for a walk, spend some time back at the lake-- maybe-- —He couldn't. He felt his face get hot from embarrassment. The silence was overbearing— Uh, I don't know. I thought it be nice to uh, do something cool together? —His voice ended in a question against his will. Was she looking at him? It felt like she was.

Their march started to slow down suddenly, and <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> was too awkward to look at her. —Just-- Or we could do something different if you'd like? —*Another question!* Was the table getting way heavier or was that just him? His biceps spiked in pain as he had to scramble to keep the panel from falling down— Hey-- <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>, are you even...? —When he finally looked at her, only the back of her head looked back. She hadn't been paying attention. His cheeks burned up even more— <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/>, what the hell--

Before he had a chance to keep complaining, <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/blue_love_interest"/>Maia<span type="end"/> dropped the panel entirely to the ground and <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/> was left to keep the thing upright as he watched her make a run for it. Where was she going? When he looked around, he saw that it wasn't only her, but everybody around him was looking right at the entrance of the palisade and she was the only one running towards it. Someone new had arrived.

…Oh. *Oh*. His breath slowed down. A man on a horse had just gone still at the entrance. They would have looked menacing if not for the state of them. The horse had obviously been a vigorous buckskin male in better times, but was horrifyingly, skeletally skinny now. The man was completely slumped over, his face hidden to <span id="World building/N A M E S.md/mc_blue"/>George<span type="end"/><span type="end"/>'s view on the other side of the horse's neck. His clothing looked thin, filthy and burnt black in some places, the fabric bunched over on his knees and boots.
