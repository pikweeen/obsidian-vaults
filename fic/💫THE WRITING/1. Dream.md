George did not remember Maia's father to be so terrifying, although most likely he wasn't the type of man to go around scaring young men *before* they've "gotten with" his daughter, so George guessed it made sense.

Dr. Edgar Achar seemed to be very reserved, much like his daughter. A tall, lanky gentleman, quietly confident in his status, the kind you'd expect to have crazy comebacks when it matters. Except he didn't. His mouth could be sealed shut as far as George knew, but his deep, sunken eyes could speak all the same. The man communicated through subtle brow gestures and soft smiles, dark eyebags protruding below his eyes and thin lips the single points of interest to decipher him, his wife and kids wordlessly understanding and acting through.

Entering through the door of the Achar household required first holding eye contact with Dr. Achar for a solid ten seconds as you approached the house, the man endlessly rocking on his old chair in the porch, his image missing only a shotgun for him to wipe and wipe while threateningly eyeing you up and down. 

Maia was so similar to him in so many ways.

Grey irises behind hooded lids watched quietly, registering his micro expressions, reading his words by looking instead of hearing. George didn't even think she was trying to judge, but rather just learning every little thing about his mannerisms, deciphering what he *really* meant when he said *x* or *y* by memory like she had to recite it all by the end of every day. 

Her lips were strangely soft and still when they kissed, George could feel her ungiving teeth right behind them with little force. She was not tentative, never experimented with movement. It seemed she only kissed him first to give him permission to start the kisses from then on. And yet she laughed at his jokes, her touch felt strangely endearing, made him feel warm and fuzzy, and he found her smell to be nice and intoxicating.

In the morning of their second week together the sky was a light shade of blue and the village was bustling with activity, coming in and out of Maia's house with the relaxed, mundane energy often found in groups of middle-aged people working together to make an event happen: a big feast, inviting all of Maia's and George's family tree. It had been their mothers' idea. The big table would be hosted in an inner patio in her house, whose walls had for years remained covered in faintly colored wall shrubs nurturing hundreds of little bright orange flowers, organized in rounded clusters which to George's eyes would make perfect gifts for a girl such as Maia, but he decided nobody would appreciate being gifted flowers from their own garden.

The two had been tasked with busy work for the entirety of the day it seemed, right up until the second of the feast which was to happen in the late afternoon.
