In very general terms...
George has always been an observer. He's never really been noticed as a middle child in a town with better and more important things to pay attention to, and now he feels like, as much as he belongs in his town, it wouldn't make much of a difference if he wasn't.

And he's bored now, too. He finds life in town boring. The perspective of marrying Maia and building a life entirely with her seemed attractive at first, because it meant change, but ultimately he realized he does know what that leads to. The life his parents led. There comes a point when, thinking about it, George knows where the few paths ahead of him lead, and he's *bored*.

Going to the Nether, so largely unexplored, so deliciously forbidden by God, so incredibly lethal to fools like himself. George is a SCHOLAR for that shit. He wants to know all about it. Meeting Illumina and learning about him helps this apathy immenselyâ€”-it gives him something to look forward to that he's passionate about.
