Dream and George are not too attached to each other during the homestead arc.

---

George has been thinking about how he wanted an adventure and to run away and have a different life than the one he imagined for himself, and now he sees how fucking dangerous and deadly it is. But he still likes it, somehow. **He secretly feels good about what happened,** because he got to feel like a hero. It was exciting. He feels guilty about feeling good though, so he's struggling with that.
He's kind of pondering leaving to the Nether alone. There's nothing he particularly looks for in there, he just wants to explore and learn and the threat of death is simply too tempting to pass on. This is related to [[George's apathy]]. ^5234d7

Dream is becoming increasingly obsessed with achieving what he wants in the Nether, although he's losing sight of what it was in the first place ([[Dream's Nether motivation]]). He hates that he owes his life to George, that half man he barely held any respect towards before this. He hates the quiet life and he hates the noise. He hates Callahan's quiet, he hates George's nagging. He hates work and he hates not working, he hates *hates* the perspective of going back into the Nether and he hates thinking about never doing it. 
He's [[ptsd|constantly annoyed]], constantly about to burst, to cry. The only times he's truly calm are when he smokes hobbit style in the inn at the town. He also like. [[The girl Dream fucks|Fucks a girl]] that works at the inn. And it feels good but he's kinda using this to blow off steam so it's perhaps a bit aggressive (she loves it dw).
