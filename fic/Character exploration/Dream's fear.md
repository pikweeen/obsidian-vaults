[[The Body Keeps the Score]]

After the trauma, it’s weird how he immediately wants to go back.

Dream trying a third time doesn’t mean he isn’t terrified. Every time he tries he’s more petrified of the Nether, every time he comes back with more cracks in his mind, **this is what i want his arc to be all about**.

The third time he crosses to the other side of the portal he’s shacking like a leaf, his chest is heavy, his eyes burn and he feels like he’s about to burst out crying.
