## How to kill
Endermen are squid-like creatures, but with the weightlessness of jellyfish. Their meat is barely-there translucent black fillets of vaguely fish and tar smelling skin. The substance is still surprisingly strong and resistant to attack, since it will quickly adapt to the shape of any object that comes into contact with it. It's practically impossible to kill an enderman with a thrust weapon like a spear, but a decisive slash from left to right, if done quick and with enough force, will slice right across them.
## How to eat
Their meat is a good source of protein and liquids, but most humans find the taste and texture revolting. Lava-dried enderman meat, cut in thin slices for better dry storage, is a very common meal for piglin to carry around on long journeys. Dried enderman meat surprisingly becomes more palatable to humans and other overworldlings. 
The experience of hybrids on this meat suggests it's mostly an acquired taste and has no real relation to species.
## How to harvest
Endermen hold their pearls in a small pocket in their heads. If killed, an enderman often exhausts its supply in an attempt to save its own life, rendering the killing useless. It is recommendable to kill endermen as painlessly and suddenly as possible in order to maximize the harvest.
The meat around the pocket needs to be cut to get to the pearls. With a sharp enough scalpel-like knife this can be done straightforwardly, but anything less than that becomes unworkable. 
Many stomp on their heads to make the meat come undone, breaking the pearls in the process. This is not a good idea. Enderman meat is elastic, but not infinitely so. The best course of action would be to stake their heads into the ground, and, using another pointy object, catch the mouth and stretch it out until the pocket rips apart.

# As a species
## Teleportation
Perhaps the most recognizable sound in the Nether is the terrifying buzz of an enderman teleporting right next to you. Endermen carry with them a few pearls which they use to quickly travel to strategic spots in the interest of hunting of fleeing.
It is unknown to humans how endermen do this. After harvesting them, humans throw them using their hands and then appear where the pearl lands and breaks. In reality, endermen have a weak sense of manifestation, where they are able to focus their attention on a single spot they can either see or feel very well, and at their will, one of their pearls can violently be removed from their body and explode into the place they concentrated on, teleporting them.
As painful as it may sound, endermen don't have a sense of pain in the traditional sense. Teleporting damages their body, but it is very quickly healed, and they get a rush of pleasure from it. Some endermen may describe it as adrenaline, others just say it's a fun thing to do, like humans may describe a backflip even when it hurts the soles of their feet or makes them dizzy.

## Reproduction
Endermen have the ability to reproduce asexually through fission (if big enough, and if the environment is safe enough, a piece detached from an enderman's body has a chance of growing into an enderling), which clones the individual. 
Sexual reproduction is also possible, where through penetration an individual introduces a piece of itself in another, who nurtures it to viability inside its own body (the enderling can be seen from outside the skin, given endermen have a translucent appearance) resulting in a new individual with DNA from both parents. It is rather rare for an enderling to come to full term using this method (around 10% chance of success), but the frequency of breeding sessions amongst endermen prevents them from dying out due to that.
## Social behaviour
Although often seen on their own, endermen are a colony-based species. They meet in groups ranging from 5 to 30 individuals, where the stronger ones share food and resources, and group hibernation and breeding happens. 
#### Migration
Endermen are largely not a migratory species, but group-wide trips are common leading up to hibernation, which happens every few weeks. The trip may never last longer than a full day, where the group walks to a destination and individuals from the colony join it along the way from around the Nether. 
It is extremely dangerous, and sadly common, to encounter colonies of endermen in this stage due to a few factors:
- Endermen run on very little rest when on their own, working fiercely for food and resources in the Nether. When hibernation time comes, every single individual is **often very cranky** and wants to get to the destination as soon as possible. They will attempt to wipe out any being that crosses their path, even if no aggression is displayed towards them.
- While individuals may appear cowardly when encountered alone, **endermen gain their courage in numbers**. If joined with as little as two other members of its colony, an enderman will endlessly, confidently and aggressively face any battle.
- It has been proven endermen gain a lot of happiness from teleporting. When hibernation time comes, most endermen have already used up most if not all of their pearls in scavenging; it is not uncommon for endermen to **become very depressed at having to walk such long distances** without the joys of instant travel (same, girl). Once again, this makes them aggressive towards beings that they perceive to be delaying the trip.

#### The many uses of hibernation
The hibernation mechanics of endermen are very unique to the species. They settle down and their body becomes softer while remaining partially alert to potential danger and appearing wide awake, even moving repetitively in some cases. This, they may do on their own on longer hunting periods or when lost.
When joined with their colony, endermen will almost always look for a small clearing in a blue warped forest, and their bodies will become soft to the point of appearing like a viscous, shapeless goo. 
In this state, the bodies of a full colony of endermen may cover the ground, walls and the surface of trees in a small area. This is how enderman hibernation gains its many other uses.
##### Hunting
Firstly, when animals, critters or intelligent individuals of different species happen to step on the puddle, which is very common since blue warped forests can get dark and difficult to navigate, endermen all over the colony receive a nervous impulse and partially regain consciousness. Some of their tentacles are able to creep out of the puddle and grab the prey, and if it can't escape in time, the endermen will collectively and progressively pull it down to the ground and asphyxiate it by placing themselves over their airways. When the prey is fully dead, endermen will cover its body with theirs and very slowly eat it over a few days. 
It is very common to encounter these enderman puddles with a large number of critters and a few larger animals lying dead on them.
##### Breeding
Due to the nature of hibernation in endermen, their bodies largely melt together and it is inevitable that individuals, when regaining their shape, will trap pieces of each other inside their bodies and can then nurture them into enderlings. It is very common for about a third of the colony to come out in this state after hibernation.
##### Pearl generation
Pearls are evidently an essential piece of the life of endermen. When on their own, individuals are often too stressed to concentrate on generating pearls, so this generally happens during colony hibernation.
The puddle will often seep into protected cavities in the ground or in trees, and the colony will focus a lot of its energy on that spot, where pearls are then generated. During one week-long period of hibernation, endermen may generate five to ten pearls per individual in the colony. They are distributed when endermen regain their shape.
Expert travellers, scavengers and opportunists will go out looking for hibernation spots and quietly steal these pearls before being spotted, although many find their fate trying, and it's widely not considered to be worth it unless one is seriously skilled.
