- Blue warped forests should have a Black Forest from the Hobbit kinda vibe, in that the air is slightly poisonous and given in high doses can kill you or at the very least knock you out. Dream and George could gather the spores emitted by the blue fungi, which are what give the effect, and use them as drugs to sleep better. They are very relaxing although slightly hallucinogen.
	- Blue warped spores, with their hallucinogen properties, I want to use as basically ecstasy and be as such an empathy booster. We should have a scene where Dream and George are having a really deep, cool conversation while on drugs.
