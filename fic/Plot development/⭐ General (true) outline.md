So what we’re picking from all of that is that,,

- George’s mom is pro Maia, she wants them to get together.
    
- Maia’s mom welcomes Dream and then kicks him out once they find out that he went to the Nether. [[First outline of beginning#^0121a7|Dramatically]].
    - Dream wants Maia as his travel partner, but she refuses, and the drama happens.
- Dream lives as a bum in town for a few weeks. In that time, his face covered in bandages except for eyes and mouth is really striking to George.

- George gets with Maia, and one night when she’s asleep on his chest and he’s thinking about their future together, he sees Dream sneak out, and [[First outline of beginning#^5122f7|decides he's going with him]].
    
- A first attempt at going to the nether happens, which ultimately culminates in [[The Carry]]. This one should be very short. Dream loses an eye here. 
	[[Leading up to the Carry]]
    
- They end up at Callahan’s, who’s a mute hermit. Callahan takes care of Dream and removes his damaged eyeball.
    - Dream becomes traumatized from the whole “looking into the eyes of a God of Death”. From then on he has extremely vivid nightmares along with a sort of rage burning inside of him in the day, where he wants to fight someone, to get hit, to yell, like a **caged animal _(subconsciously he needs a goddamn distraction)_. He feels like the ground is about to crumble beneath his feet (which isn’t too far-fetched in the Nether).
        [[Dream's fear]]
		[[Dream's missing eye]]
       
- Him and George work at Callahan’s homestead to earn resources and money for the third (and last) try. The homestead is a short distance away from the nearest town, and very close to the nearest portal, since George was able to get there at a slow walking pace in about half a day.
    - In this time, although work is good for Dream's mind, he really is still like a caged animal whenever he has nothing to do. When his focus is disturbed from work he becomes extremely irritable, snappy and aggressive. This nervous wreck is what carries him on to the portal.
      
- Dream and George fight physically one time during this time, in a culmination of tensions in the time they've had to live together. George is extremely hurtful to Dream because of a personal/spiritual lacking.
	[[their struggles in the first third]]
	[[George and Dream fight in homestead]]
	
- Right after the fight, Dream leaves at night, in secret. He takes most of the money and durable resources they had saved up. George is angry, but can't shake the feeling that if Dream dies out there, it will be his fault. He explains everything to Callahan, quickly, and then leaves after Dream with the rest of their savings.
	  
- Something something. **George and Dream start on separate paths**. George looks for him at the inn, where he's told he came by last night but didn't stay. From now on this is crossed stories.
	  
- George goes into the portal. He takes a moment to study it calmly, since he didn't get a chance to take it all in the last time. He goes in. He's more excited and giddy than he is scared. He travels in no real particular direction, carefully like a weasel, and ends up at Illumina's hut in the Nether. This is huge for him. He spends a long ass time with him, learning about living beings in the Nether (animals, plants, fungus and predators). This is like his dream. George is nothing if not a scholar.
  (For future reference, Illumina teaches George, among other things, that piglins are intelligent creatures).
	  
- Dream on his part is shown to travel in a slightly different direction. He walks towards a Fortress that is quite a long way ahead. On the way, his state of mind is pretty foggy and anxious, and that doesn't mix well with his newly missing eye. He has to get used to that, but has many accidents along the way. It's an all-round shitty, dangerous experience which he hates every second of. 
- He has a victory where he encounters an enderman and actually defeats it. He retrieves its pearl triumphantly but does not gets its meat. George will teach him later that this is possible.
	  
- Dream encounters a Ghast. Panics, runs, ends up passing out next to a kid piglin who helps him, but he kills it in a panic when he wakes up. He feels immense guilt because of this.
	[[How Dream murdered a piglin]]
	
- George finds the body of the piglin in a hunting session, with a few days of decomposition. He is horrified. He specifically notices the violent way it died (force? freak accident?) This doesn't necessarily happen *after* we see Dream kill it. Which way will be more impactful depends on how _**you**_ write it.
	He won't come back from this hunting session (he will get stuck with Dream, and Illumina will have to go out to find him).
	
-  I do not know if writing Technoblade into this would be in bad taste. But I just fucking love Techno as a character. So
	I want Dream to somehow eventually find (or get found) by Technoblade, who's a piglin. I want him to check Dream to see if he has any gold on him, neutral piglin style, and nod when he finds his golden necklace.
	Technoblade will help Dream relax and finally come out of the shock he's been in ever since the incident. 
	  
- Techno will be the one to help Dream to treat his PTSD by helping him regain agency. That is to say, he will help him be strong, engage with the things that terrify him. He will listen to Dream talk about what happened like a proud war veteran who has defined himself through his trauma. 
	
	At this point though, Dream will still be stuck in the "revel in my life failures" stage, where *talking* about *what happened* is all you're really doing without any real progress. 

- George encounters another clue of Dream's presence (dead kid piglin was the first). [FILL IN]
-  The incident happens.
-  At some point, Dream and George end up stuck in a place together, both got lost and ended up finding each other at their lowest points. Dream still in a terrible place mentally but also entitled because he's friends with Technoblade, and George completely closed up and apathetic about the whole traumatic event, also partially entitled in a "I don't need you anymore" kinda way now that he's with Illumina.
- [[Stuck alone together on ecstasy]]
	After the encounter and the ecstasy, the relationship changes dramatically.
- With Illumina, George has been retrieving blaze powder because he's been hunting all kinds of different beasts in the Nether as a learning experience. Illumina is an extremely academic man, and George is no slouch next to him. When Dream and George are already on better terms, George reveals that he already has all the powder they need, and Dream also has a single ender pearl, so they turn it into an eye together and it's beautiful and creepy.




- When they get to the ender portal and enter, Dream has visions. He sees everything about Sapnap, how he died peacefully and he's been looking for nothing. When him and George spawn in the end, Dream can't get up off the floor. The dragon breathes out calmly, docile. Dream breathes out. This brings him peace. (this is the sort of ending i want)
