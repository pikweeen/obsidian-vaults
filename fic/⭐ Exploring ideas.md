THIS BOOK IS ABOUT FEAR.
- [deprecated] start of the adventure
    
    1. OK I was thinking that a way to remove the need for them to bond at this stage (post first Dream encounter at Veer household, they both still at village), and also for it to feel less slow, I could just COMPLETELY SKIP the thing where they try twice?? And just have them try once, and George just trails after Dream when he leaves, and The Carry happens at the very end. However I do think that’s too reminiscent of the Hobbit……. Because that’s literally just exactly what Bilbo does.
    
    But let’s explore this idea. Maybe we can do the trailing a bit more originally, rather than just “IM GOING ON AN ADVENTURE EVERYBODY”. The first thing that comes to mind is to have the trailing be longer, as in, Dream leaves, George waits then leaves, tries tracking him down, eventually decides he can do it on his own, something happens to him, he decides he no longer can, is found by Dream. Then its like, wow, George got further than i did. in so much shorter a time. i— yes i would appreciate having him by my side in a non romantic way thank you.
    
    You know??
    
    Encuentro fortuito.
    
    In any case they should go through fundamentally different paths. They can both pass through the same place occasionally but not go the exact same path. Thats-- okay thats fine but i did want to add this thing where dream scams a scammer and george knows dream was there because he saw the scammer and the scammer talks about dream and george goes “yes that must be dream youre talking about” and i did like that. The only way i see rn to reconcile these 2 ideas is to make george be detectivesque and build up a notion of how Dream is in his head. Which I think is just going to be funny in a bad way and boring because it would take too long. Yeah scratch that.
    
    Okay I have a better idea. Make them go completely different paths that sometimes cross, like, they might both visit the same city one time, but not at the same time (until they actually find each other), and make George find out more and more about Dream as he hears about him from astonished villagers. George had a feeling Dream was special, but everytime he hears about him, he sounds like a fucking legend. YOU KNOW?? That way when the scammed scammer talks about him, George kinda knows. He kinda becomes like a legend hunter.
    
    True 2. ACTUALLY i was thinking

    And also I do like that idea from a few days ago of George ending up deciding he doesn't need to find Dream because he can do it on his own. He can join a few merchants in a cart and that's how he goes quicker, one of them teaches him how to fight or whatever, like valuable flashy skills, and George is so fucking happy and then stays at the destination town for a few weeks training and learning camping skills so as to not immediately die in the nether. Because he has full intentions to head in as soon as he feels ready. Later when he's with Dream he will realize just how much of a dead man he would've been had he dared go in alone. Then while he's doing his routine or taking a walk he finds dream, or encounters him, or maybe George is making the guards company as they secure the area and then they encounter Dream in the vicinity of the town. YK?????
    
    AND THEN when they do find him what's happening is the guards are telling George about a gang or well not gang it's the 13th century ffs but like a group of armed thieves that wanna thieve around and be big baddies and they wear masks and then they find a masked guy (who is NOT Dream) and he was yelling a name when they got him to the ground so the guy doesn't immediately pop out but s few minutes later they're already walking ahead like well I guess we will find him eventually and THEN HE SILENTLY POPS OUT. So there's 2 guards + George. Dream kills one, the other guard sees him and starts fighting him and calls for George so they 2v1 him but the guard falls before George because he's still the main guy who dream is facing, not rlly paying any mind to George yet. no the second guard is not dead yet he's just on the ground so George is like TERRIFIED and he HASN'T recognized dream yet because he's masked like the others. so so so uh uh sorry I can't d. dk. dkdndm. BASICALLY george is super worried about this guy who's on the floor like SPEECHLESS like he can't even believe this level of danger is going on and hejust FREEZES as he watches Dream looking at George carefully for a few seconds, evaluating whether he's about to jump at him and therefore whether he's a danger or not. Dream doesn't even recognize him at first, then he does, and he just wants to PUNCH the coward because again dream holds no respect whatsoever towards George so he doesn't even dignify him with a fight he just decks him in the jaw and and and George falls to the floor but kinda springs back like dizzy as fuck and then kinda falls again then ultimately gets half up and tries to get his weapon and then FULLY FAINTS. well that's a bit of a lolazo for a single punch. Maybe he kicks him when he´s on the ground. anyway. my idea was that when he wakes up he finds dream still on the ground and his companion GONE, and the guard still on the floor, and the other guard just dead. and then curing bonding moment. after some mistrust.
    
    OKay all of the green-yellow part now that i see it, is kind of funny in a bad way. I have to find a way to make the fight happen without making Dream out to be john wick. But whenever you come back to this, what I want to happen is that George is in this new village, training, finds Dream somehow in a fight scene where George understands that Dream thinks he’s worse than the dirt he steps on.
    
- [deprecated] plagiarizing a fanfic hbomb dont come at me (motivation 4 dream)
    
    Okay so my mind is wandering but i think a good motivation for Dream, like secret secret that he doesnt tell george until there is some more trust between the two. It’s not only the will to become god or a hero or whatever. It’s that he has someone back home who is very ill, for whom he is planning to get the powers Illumina might've had, to be able to heal them. He is under the impression that Illumina actually has like magic powers, when in reality he is just basically a witch who specializes in nether and end stuff, and who didnt end up going to the End anyway. And the only way to heal someone of any illness is by using a lingering potion, but Dream doesn’t know that yet: his main goal will be to find Illumina and have him do it for him, or explain to him how to do it. He doesn’t even think that it would be even further than the nether, but when they find Illumina, he tells him that he needs to do what he himself didn’t dare do, and go to the End. Then after this, after they get the blaze rods or whatever equivalent you come up with, and they’re heading back to the overworld, the big deathly event happens and The Carry gets to happen. This turns the carry into an emotional climax more than a simple inconvenience so i like it.
    
- [deprecated] dumbass motivation for dream
    
    A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND KIND OF CRACKEY IDEA THO maybeeeee dream escapes the village alright and he still has debts or something like escaping is like a big deal and it makes people mad and then hay una partida de búsqueda WHICH GEORGE JOINS and everyone falls on the way like they stay in different areas or DIE or just find better things to do and then its just. George. With a vague sense of commitment to finding him. And it dies down so he decides to go back but then its like. boom. they find each other at that exact moment.
    
- [deprecated] crack idea (cargo)
    
    just so you know having george escape inside a merchant cargo is the literal best idea ever and if it doesnt happen i WILL riot.
    
- [deprecated] crack idea (bushes)
    
    YO MAYBE he should find dream for the first time like hidden somewhere LMAO like yk???? hiding somewhere from someone and george just has to act casual so as to not frame him but LMAOOO its so funny to me just a little guy hidden in the bushes
    
- trixtin as death
    
    its been like 6 months this is all completely incomprehensible
    
    okay. so the lingering potion bit is kinda the worst thing ever because its just straight up stolen, like no changes, 100% just a bit from a different fic. i also rolled my eyes because ooh. like. ooh. he has a ill loved one. oo. The merchant bit is kind of better, i liked it. The merchants can maybe be two guys, one being a guard who can teach george some shit. it could actually be a very very old philza+trixtin couple. like elderly. and philza is still like super powerful and in his eyes u can see like. the things hes seen, the wisdom, the infinitude. and trixtin is like full on like Death, too. It's just all of this is never said outright, just the general feel and sensation that George has about them will be on this line. Just as a fun little wink. Maybe even Trixtin could come back as a recurrent metaphor/figure as Death whenever George feels like he is going to die. She could have her eyes covered because looking at her would carry the same sensation as “looking into the eyes of a god of death” like the volcano and that would be fucking traumatizing so she wears a fabric around her eyes. For this to be warranted Trixtin should have a big impact on George, maybe have an important conversation, or say something really cool, or be all-quiet but seem to understand everything he’s thinking about.
    
- feb-2024 + intro to ptsd
    
    its been another 6 months and i dont even know if i wanna do this anymore. So for starters. Most of the guard stuff is deprecated.
    
    I come back every time i read about a new trope i didnt realize was a trope. So. For starters. Dream needs to be a changed man after The Carry because like its all set for that yk?? He looks into the eyes of a god of death, almost dies, owes it all to George. Dream needs to be in a painfully deep debt to him, and perhaps he doesn’t like that. His body isn’t doing all it used to do (he’s missing an eye, he has scarring on his face and arms from the burning debris).
